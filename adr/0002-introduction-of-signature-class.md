# 2. introduction-of-signature-class

Date: 2024-03-14

## Status

Accepted

## Context

I noticed significant overuse of primitive strings for signatures, which led to widespread and repetitive validation logic, increasing the potential for errors and making the system harder to manage and maintain.

## Decision

I introduced the Nostr::Signature class, choosing to subclass String to leverage string-like behavior while embedding specific validation rules for signatures. This move was aimed at streamlining validation, ensuring consistency, and maintaining the usability of strings.

## Consequences

### Positive

- This design choice has made the codebase cleaner and more robust, reducing the chances of errors related to signature handling. It ensures that all signature instances are valid at creation, leveraging the familiarity and flexibility of string operations without sacrificing the integrity of the data. Moreover, it sets a strong foundation for extending signature-related functionality in the future.

### Negative

- __Performance Concerns:__ Subclassing String might introduce slight performance overheads due to the additional validation logic executed upon instantiation of a Signature object.
- __Integration Challenges:__ Integrating this class into existing systems where strings were used indiscriminately for signatures requires careful refactoring to ensure compatibility. There's also the potential for issues when passing Nostr::Signature objects to libraries or APIs expecting plain strings without the additional constraints.
- __Learning Curve:__ For new team members or contributors, understanding the necessity and functionality of the Nostr::Signature class adds to the learning curve, potentially slowing down initial development efforts as they familiarize themselves with the custom implementation.
